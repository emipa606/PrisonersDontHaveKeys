# PrisonersDontHaveKeys

I found it odd that prisoners could open doors when escaping when fleeing raiders cannot. 
So this mod makes prisoner having to bash doors when escaping as well.

There is also a mod-option to allow prisoners to open cell-doors during a prison break but not other doors. This is to simulate that the prisoner have found a way to open the door and that is the start of the prison break.

Since 1.3 added slaves the mod can be applied to rebelling slaves as well by enabling it in the mod-options.
